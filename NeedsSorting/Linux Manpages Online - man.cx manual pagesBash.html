<h2><a href="https://man.cx/bash#heading4" name="heading4">DESCRIPTION
</a></h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Bash</b> is
an <b>sh</b>-compatible command language interpreter that
executes commands read from the standard input or from a
file. <b>Bash</b> also incorporates useful features from the
<i>Korn</i> and <i>C</i> shells (<b>ksh</b> and
<b>csh</b>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Bash</b> is
intended to be a conformant implementation of the Shell and
Utilities portion of the IEEE POSIX specification (IEEE
Standard 1003.1). <b>Bash</b> can be configured to be
POSIX-conformant by default.</p>

<h2><a href="https://man.cx/bash#heading5" name="heading5">OPTIONS
</a></h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All of the
single-character shell options documented in the description
of the <b>set</b> builtin command, including
<b>−o</b>, can be used as options when the shell is
invoked. In addition, <b>bash</b> interprets the following
options when it is invoked:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tbody><tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p><b>−c</b></p></td>
<td width="12%"></td>
<td width="74%">


<p>If the <b>−c</b> option is present, then commands
are read from the first non-option argument
<i>command_string</i>. If there are arguments after the
<i>command_string</i>, the first argument is assigned to
<b>$0</b> and any remaining arguments are assigned to the
positional parameters. The assignment to <b>$0</b> sets the
name of the shell, which is used in warning and error
messages.</p> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p><b>−i</b></p></td>
<td width="12%"></td>

<td width="3%">


<p><b>−s</b></p></td>
<td width="12%"></td>
<td width="74%">


<p>If the <b>−s</b> option is present, or if no
arguments remain after option processing, then commands are
read from the standard input. This option allows the
positional parameters to be set when invoking an interactive
shell or when reading input through a pipe.</p></td></tr>

<p style="margin-left:26%;"><i>shopt_option</i> is one of
the shell options accepted by the <b>shopt</b> builtin (see
<b><small>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</small></b> below). If
<i>shopt_option</i> is present, <b>−O</b> sets the
value of that option; <b>+O</b> unsets it. If
<i>shopt_option</i> is not supplied, the names and values of
the shell options accepted by <b>shopt</b> are printed on
the standard output. If the invocation option is <b>+O</b>,
the output is displayed in a format that may be reused as

<h2><a href="https://man.cx/bash#heading6" name="heading6">ARGUMENTS
</a></h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If arguments
remain after option processing, and neither the
<b>−c</b> nor the <b>−s</b> option has been
supplied, the first argument is assumed to be the name of a
file containing shell commands. If <b>bash</b> is invoked in
this fashion, <b>$0</b> is set to the name of the file, and
the positional parameters are set to the remaining
arguments. <b>Bash</b> reads and executes commands from this
file, then exits. <b>Bash</b>’s exit status is the
exit status of the last command executed in the script. If
no commands are executed, the exit status is 0. An attempt
is first made to open the file in the current directory,
and, if no file is found, then the shell searches the
directories in <b><small>PATH</small></b> for the
script.</p>

<h2><a href="https://man.cx/bash#heading7" name="heading7">INVOCATION
</a></h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A <i>login
shell</i> is one whose first character of argument zero is a
<b>−</b>, or one started with the
<b>−−login</b> option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An
<i>interactive</i> shell is one started without non-option
arguments (unless <b>−s</b> is specified) and without
the <b>−c</b> option whose standard input and error
are both connected to terminals (as determined by
<a href="https://man.cx/isatty(3)">isatty(3)</a>), or one started with the <b>−i</b>
option. <b><small>PS1</small></b> is set and <b>$−</b>
includes <b>i</b> if <b>bash</b> is interactive, allowing a
shell script or a startup file to test this state.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
paragraphs describe how <b>bash</b> executes its startup
files. If any of the files exist but cannot be read,
<b>bash</b> reports an error. Tildes are expanded in
filenames as described below under <b>Tilde Expansion</b> in
the <b><small>EXPANSION</small></b> section.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When
<b>bash</b> is invoked as an interactive login shell, or as
a non-interactive shell with the <b>−−login</b>
option, it first reads and executes commands from the file
<i>/etc/profile</i>, if that file exists. After reading that
file, it looks for <i>~/.bash_profile</i>,
<i>~/.bash_login</i>, and <i>~/.profile</i>, in that order,
and reads and executes commands from the first one that
exists and is readable. The <b>−−noprofile</b>
option may be used when the shell is started to inhibit this
behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When an
interactive login shell exits, or a non-interactive login
shell executes the <b>exit</b> builtin command, <b>bash</b>
reads and executes commands from the file
<i>~/.bash_logout</i>, if it exists.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When an
interactive shell that is not a login shell is started,
<b>bash</b> reads and executes commands from
<i>/etc/bash.bashrc</i> and <i>~/.bashrc</i>, if these files
exist. This may be inhibited by using the
<b>−−norc</b> option. The
<b>−−rcfile</b> <i>file</i> option will force
<b>bash</b> to read and execute commands from <i>file</i>
instead of <i>/etc/bash.bashrc</i> and <i>~/.bashrc</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When
<b>bash</b> is started non-interactively, to run a shell
script, for example, it looks for the variable
<b><small>BASH_ENV</small></b> in the environment, expands
its value if it appears there, and uses the expanded value
as the name of a file to read and execute. <b>Bash</b>
behaves as if the following command were executed:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">if [ −n
"$BASH_ENV" ]; then . "$BASH_ENV";
fi</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">but the value of the
<b><small>PATH</small></b> variable is not used to search
for the filename.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If <b>bash</b>
is invoked with the name <b>sh</b>, it tries to mimic the
startup behavior of historical versions of <b>sh</b> as
closely as possible, while conforming to the POSIX standard
as well. When invoked as an interactive login shell, or a
non-interactive shell with the <b>−−login</b>
option, it first attempts to read and execute commands from
<i>/etc/profile</i> and <i>~/.profile</i>, in that order.
The <b>−−noprofile</b> option may be used to
inhibit this behavior. When invoked as an interactive shell
with the name <b>sh</b>, <b>bash</b> looks for the variable
<b><small>ENV</small></b><small>,</small> expands its value
if it is defined, and uses the expanded value as the name of
a file to read and execute. Since a shell invoked as
<b>sh</b> does not attempt to read and execute commands from
any other startup files, the <b>−−rcfile</b>
option has no effect. A non-interactive shell invoked with
the name <b>sh</b> does not attempt to read any other
startup files. When invoked as <b>sh</b>, <b>bash</b> enters
<i>posix</i> mode after the startup files are read.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When
<b>bash</b> is started in <i>posix</i> mode, as with the
<b>−−posix</b> command line option, it follows
the POSIX standard for startup files. In this mode,
interactive shells expand the <b><small>ENV</small></b>
variable and commands are read and executed from the file
whose name is the expanded value. No other startup files are
read.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Bash</b>
attempts to determine when it is being run with its standard
input connected to a network connection, as when executed by
the remote shell daemon, usually <i>rshd</i>, or the secure
shell daemon <i>sshd</i>. If <b>bash</b> determines it is
being run in this fashion, it reads and executes commands
from <i>~/.bashrc</i> and <i>~/.bashrc</i>, if these files
exist and are readable. It will not do this if invoked as
<b>sh</b>. The <b>−−norc</b> option may be used
to inhibit this behavior, and the
<b>−−rcfile</b> option may be used to force
another file to be read, but neither <i>rshd</i> nor
<i>sshd</i> generally invoke the shell with those options or
allow them to be specified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the shell is
started with the effective user (group) id not equal to the
real user (group) id, and the <b>−p</b> option is not
supplied, no startup files are read, shell functions are not
inherited from the environment, the
<b><small>SHELLOPTS</small></b><small>, <b>BASHOPTS</b>,
<b>CDPATH</b>,</small> and <b><small>GLOBIGNORE</small></b>
variables, if they appear in the environment, are ignored,
and the effective user id is set to the real user id. If the
<b>−p</b> option is supplied at invocation, the
startup behavior is the same, but the effective user id is
not reset.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>metacharacter</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">A character that, when
unquoted, separates words. One of the following: <b><br>
| &amp; ; ( ) &lt; &gt; space tab newline</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>control operator</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">A <i>token</i> that performs a
control function. It is one of the following symbols:

<h2><a href="https://man.cx/bash#heading9" name="heading9">RESERVED WORDS
</a></h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><i>Reserved
words</i></b> are words that have a special meaning to the
shell. The following words are recognized as reserved when
unquoted and either the first word of a simple command (see
<b><small>SHELL GRAMMAR</small></b> below) or the third word
of a <b>case</b> or <b>for</b> command:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>! case
coproc do done elif else esac fi for function if in select
then until while { } time [[ ]]</b></p>

<h2><a href="https://man.cx/bash#heading10" name="heading10">SHELL GRAMMAR
</a></h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Simple
Commands</b> <br>
A <i>simple command</i> is a sequence of optional variable
assignments followed by <b>blank</b>-separated words and
redirections, and terminated by a <i>control operator</i>.
The first word specifies the command to be executed, and is
passed as argument zero. The remaining words are passed as
arguments to the invoked command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The return
value of a <i>simple command</i> is its exit status, or
128+<i>n</i> if the command is terminated by signal
<i>n</i>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Pipelines</b>
<br>
A <i>pipeline</i> is a sequence of one or more commands
separated by one of the control operators <b>|</b> or
<b>|&amp;</b>. The format for a pipeline is:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">[<b>time</b>
[<b>−p</b>]] [ ! ] <i>command</i> [
[<b>|</b>⎪<b>|&amp;</b>] <i>command2</i> ... ]</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The standard
output of <i>command</i> is connected via a pipe to the
standard input of <i>command2</i>. This connection is
performed before any redirections specified by the command
(see <b><small>REDIRECTION</small></b> below). If
<b>|&amp;</b> is used, <i>command</i>’s standard
error, in addition to its standard output, is connected to
<i>command2</i>’s standard input through the pipe; it
is shorthand for <b>2&gt;&amp;1 |</b>. This implicit
redirection of the standard error to the standard output is
performed after any redirections specified by the
command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The return
status of a pipeline is the exit status of the last command,
unless the <b>pipefail</b> option is enabled. If
<b>pipefail</b> is enabled, the pipeline’s return
status is the value of the last (rightmost) command to exit
with a non-zero status, or zero if all commands exit
successfully. If the reserved word <b>!</b> precedes a
pipeline, the exit status of that pipeline is the logical
negation of the exit status as described above. The shell
waits for all commands in the pipeline to terminate before
returning a value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
<b>time</b> reserved word precedes a pipeline, the elapsed
as well as user and system time consumed by its execution
are reported when the pipeline terminates. The
<b>−p</b> option changes the output format to that
specified by POSIX. When the shell is in <i>posix mode</i>,
it does not recognize <b>time</b> as a reserved word if the
next token begins with a ’-’. The
<b><small>TIMEFORMAT</small></b> variable may be set to a
format string that specifies how the timing information
should be displayed; see the description of
<b><small>TIMEFORMAT</small></b> under <b>Shell
Variables</b> below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When the shell
is in <i>posix mode</i>, <b>time</b> may be followed by a
newline. In this case, the shell displays the total user and
system time consumed by the shell and its children. The
<b><small>TIMEFORMAT</small></b> variable may be used to
specify the format of the time information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each command in
a pipeline is executed as a separate process (i.e., in a
subshell). See <b><small>COMMAND EXECUTION
ENVIRONMENT</small></b> for a description of a subshell
environment. If the <b>lastpipe</b> option is enabled using
the <b>shopt</b> builtin (see the description of
<b>shopt</b> below), the last element of a pipeline may be
run by the shell process.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Lists</b>
<br>
A <i>list</i> is a sequence of one or more pipelines
separated by one of the operators <b>;</b>, <b>&amp;</b>,
<b>&amp;&amp;</b>, or <b>||</b>, and optionally terminated
by one of <b>;</b>, <b>&amp;</b>, or
<b>&lt;newline&gt;</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Of these list
operators, <b>&amp;&amp;</b> and <b>||</b> have equal
precedence, followed by <b>;</b> and <b>&amp;</b>, which
have equal precedence.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A sequence of
one or more newlines may appear in a <i>list</i> instead of
a semicolon to delimit commands.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a command is
terminated by the control operator <b>&amp;</b>, the shell
executes the command in the <i>background</i> in a subshell.
The shell does not wait for the command to finish, and the
return status is 0. These are referred to as
<i>asynchronous</i> commands. Commands separated by a
<b>;</b> are executed sequentially; the shell waits for each
command to terminate in turn. The return status is the exit
status of the last command executed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">AND and OR
lists are sequences of one or more pipelines separated by
the <b>&amp;&amp;</b> and <b>||</b> control operators,
respectively. AND and OR lists are executed with left
associativity. An AND list has the form</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><i>command1</i>
<b>&amp;&amp;</b> <i>command2</i></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>command2</i>
is executed if, and only if, <i>command1</i> returns an exit
status of zero (success).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An OR list has
the form</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><i>list</i> is simply executed
in the current shell environment. <i>list</i> must be
terminated with a newline or semicolon. This is known as a
<i>group command</i>. The return status is the exit status
of <i>list</i>. Note that unlike the metacharacters <b>(</b>
and <b>)</b>, <b>{</b> and <b>}</b> are <i>reserved
words</i> and must occur where a reserved word is permitted
to be recognized. Since they do not cause a word break, they
must be separated from <i>list</i> by whitespace or another
shell metacharacter.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">((<i>expression</i>))</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The <i>expression</i> is
evaluated according to the rules described below under
<b><small>ARITHMETIC EVALUATION</small></b><small>.</small>
If the value of the expression is non-zero, the return
status is 0; otherwise the return status is 1. This is
exactly equivalent to <b>let
"</b><i>expression</i><b>"</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>[[</b> <i>expression</i>
<b>]]</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Return a status of 0 or 1
depending on the evaluation of the conditional expression
<i>expression</i>. Expressions are composed of the primaries
described below under <b><small>CONDITIONAL
EXPRESSIONS</small></b><small>.</small> Word splitting and
pathname expansion are not performed on the words between
the <b>[[</b> and <b>]]</b>; tilde expansion, parameter and
variable expansion, arithmetic expansion, command
substitution, process substitution, and quote removal are
performed. Conditional operators such as <b>−f</b>
must be unquoted to be recognized as primaries.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">When used with
<b>[[</b>, the <b>&lt;</b> and <b>&gt;</b> operators sort
lexicographically using the current locale.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See the
description of the <i>test</i> builtin command (section
SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below) for the handling of parameters
(i.e. missing parameters).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When the
<b>==</b> and <b>!=</b> operators are used, the string to
the right of the operator is considered a pattern and
matched according to the rules described below under
<b>Pattern Matching</b>, as if the <b>extglob</b> shell
option were enabled. The <b>=</b> operator is equivalent to
<b>==</b>. If the <b>nocasematch</b> shell option is
enabled, the match is performed without regard to the case
of alphabetic characters. The return value is 0 if the
string matches (<b>==</b>) or does not match (<b>!=</b>) the
pattern, and 1 otherwise. Any part of the pattern may be
quoted to force the quoted portion to be matched as a
string.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An additional
binary operator, <b>=~</b>, is available, with the same
precedence as <b>==</b> and <b>!=</b>. When it is used, the
string to the right of the operator is considered a POSIX
extended regular expression and matched accordingly (as in
<a href="https://man.cx/regex(3)">regex(3)</a>). The return value is 0 if the string
matches the pattern, and 1 otherwise. If the regular
expression is syntactically incorrect, the conditional
expression’s return value is 2. If the
<b>nocasematch</b> shell option is enabled, the match is
performed without regard to the case of alphabetic
characters. Any part of the pattern may be quoted to force
the quoted portion to be matched as a string. Bracket
expressions in regular expressions must be treated
carefully, since normal quoting characters lose their
meanings between brackets. If the pattern is stored in a
shell variable, quoting the variable expansion forces the
entire pattern to be matched as a string. Substrings matched
by parenthesized subexpressions within the regular
expression are saved in the array variable
<b><small>BASH_REMATCH</small></b><small>.</small> The
element of <b><small>BASH_REMATCH</small></b> with index 0
is the portion of the string matching the entire regular
expression. The element of
<b><small>BASH_REMATCH</small></b> with index <i>n</i> is
the portion of the string matching the <i>n</i>th
parenthesized subexpression.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Expressions may
be combined using the following operators, listed in
decreasing order of precedence:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>(</b> <i>expression</i>

<b>in</b> [ <i>word ...</i> ] ] ; ] <b>do</b> <i>list</i> ;
<b>done</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The list of words following
<b>in</b> is expanded, generating a list of items. The
variable <i>name</i> is set to each element of this list in
turn, and <i>list</i> is executed each time. If the
<b>in</b> <i>word</i> is omitted, the <b>for</b> command
executes <i>list</i> once for each positional parameter that
is set (see <b><small>PARAMETERS</small></b> below). The
return status is the exit status of the last command that
executes. If the expansion of the items following <b>in</b>
results in an empty list, no commands are executed, and the
return status is 0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>for</b> (( <i>expr1</i> ;
<i>expr2</i> ; <i>expr3</i> )) ; <b>do</b> <i>list</i> ;
<b>done</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">First, the arithmetic
expression <i>expr1</i> is evaluated according to the rules
described below under <b><small>ARITHMETIC
EVALUATION</small></b><small>.</small> The arithmetic
expression <i>expr2</i> is then evaluated repeatedly until
it evaluates to zero. Each time <i>expr2</i> evaluates to a
non-zero value, <i>list</i> is executed and the arithmetic
expression <i>expr3</i> is evaluated. If any expression is
omitted, it behaves as if it evaluates to 1. The return
value is the exit status of the last command in <i>list</i>
that is executed, or false if any of the expressions is
invalid.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>select</b> <i>name</i> [
<b>in</b> <i>word</i> ] ; <b>do</b> <i>list</i> ;
<b>done</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The list of words following
<b>in</b> is expanded, generating a list of items. The set
of expanded words is printed on the standard error, each
preceded by a number. If the <b>in</b> <i>word</i> is
omitted, the positional parameters are printed (see
<b><small>PARAMETERS</small></b> below). The
<b><small>PS3</small></b> prompt is then displayed and a
line read from the standard input. If the line consists of a
number corresponding to one of the displayed words, then the
value of <i>name</i> is set to that word. If the line is
empty, the words and prompt are displayed again. If EOF is
read, the command completes. Any other value read causes
<i>name</i> to be set to null. The line read is saved in the
variable <b><small>REPLY</small></b><small>.</small> The
<i>list</i> is executed after each selection until a
<b>break</b> command is executed. The exit status of
<b>select</b> is the exit status of the last command
executed in <i>list</i>, or zero if no commands were
executed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>case</b> <i>word</i>
<b>in</b> [ [(] <i>pattern</i> [ <b>|</b> <i>pattern</i> ]
... ) <i>list</i> ;; ] ... <b>esac</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">A <b>case</b> command first
expands <i>word</i>, and tries to match it against each
<i>pattern</i> in turn, using the matching rules described
under <b>Pattern Matching</b> below. The <i>word</i> is
expanded using tilde expansion, parameter and variable
expansion, arithmetic expansion, command substitution,
process substitution and quote removal. Each <i>pattern</i>
examined is expanded using tilde expansion, parameter and
variable expansion, arithmetic expansion, command
substitution, and process substitution. If the
<b>nocasematch</b> shell option is enabled, the match is
performed without regard to the case of alphabetic
characters. When a match is found, the corresponding
<i>list</i> is executed. If the <b>;;</b> operator is used,
no subsequent matches are attempted after the first pattern
match. Using <b>;&amp;</b> in place of <b>;;</b> causes
execution to continue with the <i>list</i> associated with
the next set of patterns. Using <b>;;&amp;</b> in place of
<b>;;</b> causes the shell to test the next pattern list in
the statement, if any, and execute any associated
<i>list</i> on a successful match. The exit status is zero
if no pattern matches. Otherwise, it is the exit status of
the last command executed in <i>list</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>if</b> <i>list</i>;

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The <b>if</b> <i>list</i> is
executed. If its exit status is zero, the <b>then</b>
<i>list</i> is executed. Otherwise, each <b>elif</b>
<i>list</i> is executed in turn, and if its exit status is
zero, the corresponding <b>then</b> <i>list</i> is executed
and the command completes. Otherwise, the <b>else</b>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>while</b> <i>list-1</i>;
<b>do</b> <i>list-2</i>; <b>done <br>

<b>done</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The <b>while</b> command
continuously executes the list <i>list-2</i> as long as the
last command in the list <i>list-1</i> returns an exit
status of zero. The <b>until</b> command is identical to the
<b>while</b> command, except that the test is negated:
<i>list-2</i> is executed as long as the last command in
<i>list-1</i> returns a non-zero exit status. The exit
status of the <b>while</b> and <b>until</b> commands is the
exit status of the last command executed in <i>list-2</i>,
or zero if none was executed.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Coprocesses</b>
<br>
A <i>coprocess</i> is a shell command preceded by the
<b>coproc</b> reserved word. A coprocess is executed
asynchronously in a subshell, as if the command had been
terminated with the <b>&amp;</b> control operator, with a
two-way pipe established between the executing shell and the
coprocess.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The format for
a coprocess is:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>coproc</b>
[<i>NAME</i>] <i>command</i> [<i>redirections</i>]</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This creates a
coprocess named <i>NAME</i>. If <i>NAME</i> is not supplied,
the default name is <b>COPROC</b>. <i>NAME</i> must not be
supplied if <i>command</i> is a <i>simple command</i> (see
above); otherwise, it is interpreted as the first word of
the simple command. When the coprocess is executed, the
shell creates an array variable (see <b>Arrays</b> below)
named <i>NAME</i> in the context of the executing shell. The
standard output of <i>command</i> is connected via a pipe to
a file descriptor in the executing shell, and that file
descriptor is assigned to <i>NAME</i>[0]. The standard input
of <i>command</i> is connected via a pipe to a file
descriptor in the executing shell, and that file descriptor
is assigned to <i>NAME</i>[1]. This pipe is established
before any redirections specified by the command (see
<b><small>REDIRECTION</small></b> below). The file
descriptors can be utilized as arguments to shell commands
and redirections using standard word expansions. Other than
those created to execute command and process substitutions,
the file descriptors are not available in subshells. The
process ID of the shell spawned to execute the coprocess is
available as the value of the variable <i>NAME</i>_PID. The
<b>wait</b> builtin command may be used to wait for the
coprocess to terminate.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Since the
coprocess is created as an asynchronous command, the
<b>coproc</b> command always returns success. The return
status of a coprocess is the exit status of
<i>command</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Shell
Function Definitions</b> <br>
A shell function is an object that is called like a simple
command and executes a compound command with a new set of
positional parameters. Shell functions are declared as
follows: <i><br>
name</i> () <i>compound−command</i>
[<i>redirection</i>] <b><br>
function</b> <i>name</i> [()] <i>compound−command</i>
[<i>redirection</i>]</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This defines a function named
<i>name</i>. The reserved word <b>function</b> is optional.
If the <b>function</b> reserved word is supplied, the
parentheses are optional. The <i>body</i> of the function is
the compound command <i>compound−command</i> (see
<b>Compound Commands</b> above). That command is usually a
<i>list</i> of commands between { and }, but may be any
command listed under <b>Compound Commands</b> above, with
one exception: If the <b>function</b> reserved word is used,
but the parentheses are not supplied, the braces are
required. <i>compound−command</i> is executed whenever
<i>name</i> is specified as the name of a simple command.
When in <i>posix mode</i>, <i>name</i> may not be the name
of one of the POSIX <i>special builtins</i>. Any
redirections (see <b><small>REDIRECTION</small></b> below)
specified when a function is defined are performed when the
function is executed. The exit status of a function
definition is zero unless a syntax error occurs or a
readonly function with the same name already exists. When
executed, the exit status of a function is the exit status
of the last command executed in the body. (See
<b><small>FUNCTIONS</small></b> below.)</p>

<h2><a href="https://man.cx/bash#heading11" name="heading11">COMMENTS
</a></h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In a
non-interactive shell, or an interactive shell in which the
<b>interactive_comments</b> option to the <b>shopt</b>
builtin is enabled (see <b><small>SHELL BUILTIN
COMMANDS</small></b> below), a word beginning with <b>#</b>
causes that word and all remaining characters on that line
to be ignored. An interactive shell without the
<b>interactive_comments</b> option enabled does not allow
comments. The <b>interactive_comments</b> option is on by
default in interactive shells.</p>

<h2><a href="https://man.cx/bash#heading12" name="heading12">QUOTING
</a></h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Quoting</i>
is used to remove the special meaning of certain characters
or words to the shell. Quoting can be used to disable
special treatment for special characters, to prevent
reserved words from being recognized as such, and to prevent
parameter expansion.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each of the
<i>metacharacters</i> listed above under
<b><small>DEFINITIONS</small></b> has special meaning to the
shell and must be quoted if it is to represent itself.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When the
command history expansion facilities are being used (see
<b><small>HISTORY EXPANSION</small></b> below), the
<i>history expansion</i> character, usually <b>!</b>, must
be quoted to prevent history expansion.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are three
quoting mechanisms: the <i>escape character</i>, single
quotes, and double quotes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A non-quoted
backslash (<b>\</b>) is the <i>escape character</i>. It
preserves the literal value of the next character that
follows, with the exception of &lt;newline&gt;. If a
<b>\</b>&lt;newline&gt; pair appears, and the backslash is
not itself quoted, the <b>\</b>&lt;newline&gt; is treated as
a line continuation (that is, it is removed from the input
stream and effectively ignored).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Enclosing
characters in single quotes preserves the literal value of
each character within the quotes. A single quote may not
occur between single quotes, even when preceded by a
backslash.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Enclosing
characters in double quotes preserves the literal value of
all characters within the quotes, with the exception of
<b>$</b>, <b>`</b>, <b>\</b>, and, when history expansion is
enabled, <b>!</b>. When the shell is in <i>posix mode</i>,
the <b>!</b> has no special meaning within double quotes,
even when history expansion is enabled. The characters
<b>$</b> and <b>`</b> retain their special meaning within
double quotes. The backslash retains its special meaning
only when followed by one of the following characters:
<b>$</b>, <b>`</b>, <b>"</b>, <b>\</b>, or
<b>&lt;newline&gt;</b>. A double quote may be quoted within
double quotes by preceding it with a backslash. If enabled,
history expansion will be performed unless an <b>!</b>
appearing in double quotes is escaped using a backslash. The
backslash preceding the <b>!</b> is not removed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The special
parameters <b>*</b> and <b>@</b> have special meaning when
in double quotes (see <b><small>PARAMETERS</small></b>
below).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Words of the
form <b>$</b>'<i>string</i>' are treated specially. The word
expands to <i>string</i>, with backslash-escaped characters
replaced as specified by the ANSI C standard. Backslash
escape sequences, if present, are decoded as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A

variable has a <i>value</i> and zero or more
<i>attributes</i>. Attributes are assigned using the
<b>declare</b> builtin command (see <b>declare</b> below in
<b><small>SHELL BUILTIN
COMMANDS</small></b><small>).</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A parameter is
set if it has been assigned a value. The null string is a

BUILTIN COMMANDS</small></b> below).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><i>name</i>=[<i>value</i>]</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If <i>value</i>
is not given, the variable is assigned the null string. All
<i>values</i> undergo tilde expansion, parameter and
variable expansion, command substitution, arithmetic
expansion, and quote removal (see
<b><small>EXPANSION</small></b> below). If the variable has
its <b>integer</b> attribute set, then <i>value</i> is
evaluated as an arithmetic expression even if the $((...))
expansion is not used (see <b>Arithmetic Expansion</b>
below). Word splitting is not performed, with the exception
of <b>"$@"</b> as explained below under <b>Special
Parameters</b>. Pathname expansion is not performed.
Assignment statements may also appear as arguments to the
<b>alias</b>, <b>declare</b>, <b>typeset</b>, <b>export</b>,
<b>readonly</b>, and <b>local</b> builtin commands
(<i>declaration</i> commands). When in <i>posix mode</i>,
these builtins may appear in a command after one or more

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the context
where an assignment statement is assigning a value to a
shell variable or array index, the += operator can be used
to append to or add to the variable’s previous value.
This includes arguments to builtin commands such as

(<i>declaration</i> commands). When += is applied to a
variable for which the <i>integer</i> attribute has been
set, <i>value</i> is evaluated as an arithmetic expression
and added to the variable’s current value, which is
also evaluated. When += is applied to an array variable
using compound assignment (see <b>Arrays</b> below), the
variable’s value is not unset (as it is when using =),
and new values are appended to the array beginning at one
greater than the array’s maximum index (for indexed
arrays) or added as additional key−value pairs in an
associative array. When applied to a string-valued variable,
<i>value</i> is expanded and appended to the
variable’s value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A variable can
be assigned the <i>nameref</i> attribute using the
<b>−n</b> option to the <b>declare</b> or <b>local</b>
builtin commands (see the descriptions of <b>declare</b> and
<b>local</b> below) to create a <i>nameref</i>, or a
reference to another variable. This allows variables to be
manipulated indirectly. Whenever the nameref variable is
referenced, assigned to, unset, or has its attributes
modified (other than using or changing the <i>nameref</i>
attribute itself), the operation is actually performed on
the variable specified by the nameref variable’s
value. A nameref is commonly used within shell functions to
refer to a variable whose name is passed as an argument to
the function. For instance, if a variable name is passed to
a shell function as its first argument, running</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">declare -n ref=$1</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">inside the function creates a
nameref variable <b>ref</b> whose value is the variable name
passed as the first argument. References and assignments to
<b>ref</b>, and changes to its attributes, are treated as
references, assignments, and attribute modifications to the
variable whose name was passed as <b>$1</b>. If the control
variable in a <b>for</b> loop has the nameref attribute, the
list of words can be a list of shell variables, and a name
reference will be established for each word in the list, in
turn, when the loop is executed. Array variables cannot be
given the <b>nameref</b> attribute. However, nameref
variables can reference array variables and subscripted
array variables. Namerefs can be unset using the
<b>−n</b> option to the <b>unset</b> builtin.
Otherwise, if <b>unset</b> is executed with the name of a
nameref variable as an argument, the variable referenced by
the nameref variable will be unset.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Positional
Parameters</b> <br>
A <i>positional parameter</i> is a parameter denoted by one
or more digits, other than the single digit 0. Positional
parameters are assigned from the shell’s arguments
when it is invoked, and may be reassigned using the
<b>set</b> builtin command. Positional parameters may not be
assigned to with assignment statements. The positional
parameters are temporarily replaced when a shell function is
executed (see <b><small>FUNCTIONS</small></b> below).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When a
positional parameter consisting of more than a single digit
is expanded, it must be enclosed in braces (see
<b><small>EXPANSION</small></b> below).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Special
Parameters</b> <br>
The shell treats several parameters specially. These
parameters may only be referenced; assignment to them is not
allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>BASHOPTS</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">A colon-separated list of
enabled shell options. Each word in the list is a valid
argument for the <b>−s</b> option to the <b>shopt</b>
builtin command (see <b><small>SHELL BUILTIN
COMMANDS</small></b> below). The options appearing in
<b><small>BASHOPTS</small></b> are those reported as
<i>on</i> by <b>shopt</b>. If this variable is in the
environment when <b>bash</b> starts up, each shell option in
the list will be enabled before reading any startup files.
This variable is read-only.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>BASHPID</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Expands to the process ID of
the current <b>bash</b> process. This differs from <b>$$</b>
under certain circumstances, such as subshells that do not
require <b>bash</b> to be re-initialized. Assignments to

<b>BASHPID</b> is unset, it loses its special properties,
even if it is subsequently reset.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>BASH_ALIASES</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">An associative array variable
whose members correspond to the internal list of aliases as
maintained by the <b>alias</b> builtin. Elements added to
this array appear in the alias list; however, unsetting
array elements currently does not cause aliases to be
removed from the alias list. If <b>BASH_ALIASES</b> is
unset, it loses its special properties, even if it is
subsequently reset.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>BASH_ARGC</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">An array variable whose values
are the number of parameters in each frame of the current
<b>bash</b> execution call stack. The number of parameters
to the current subroutine (shell function or script executed
with <b>.</b> or <b>source</b>) is at the top of the stack.
When a subroutine is executed, the number of parameters
passed is pushed onto
<b><small>BASH_ARGC</small></b><small>.</small> The shell
sets <b><small>BASH_ARGC</small></b> only when in extended
debugging mode (see the description of the <b>extdebug</b>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>BASH_ARGV</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">An array variable containing
all of the parameters in the current <b>bash</b> execution
call stack. The final parameter of the last subroutine call
is at the top of the stack; the first parameter of the
initial call is at the bottom. When a subroutine is
executed, the parameters supplied are pushed onto
<b><small>BASH_ARGV</small></b><small>.</small> The shell
sets <b><small>BASH_ARGV</small></b> only when in extended

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When referenced, this variable
expands to the name of the shell or shell script (identical
to <b>$0</b>; see the description of special parameter 0
above). Assignment to <b>BASH_ARGV0</b> causes the value

even if it is subsequently reset.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>BASH_CMDS</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">An associative array variable
whose members correspond to the internal hash table of
commands as maintained by the <b>hash</b> builtin. Elements
added to this array appear in the hash table; however,
unsetting array elements currently does not cause command
names to be removed from the hash table. If <b>BASH_CMDS</b>
is unset, it loses its special properties, even if it is
subsequently reset.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>BASH_COMMAND</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The command currently being

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
variables are used by the shell. In some cases, <b>bash</b>
assigns a default value to a variable; these cases are noted
below. <b><br>
BASH_COMPAT</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The value is used to set the
shell’s compatibility level. See the description of
the <b>shopt</b> builtin below under <b>SHELL BUILTIN
COMMANDS</b> for a description of the various compatibility
levels and their effects. The value may be a decimal number
(e.g., 4.2) or an integer (e.g., 42) corresponding to the
desired compatibility level. If <b>BASH_COMPAT</b> is unset
or set to the empty string, the compatibility level is set
to the default for the current version. If
<b>BASH_COMPAT</b> is set to a value that is not one of the
valid compatibility levels, the shell prints an error
message and sets the compatibility level to the default for
the current version. The valid compatibility levels
correspond to the compatibility options accepted by the
<b>shopt</b> builtin described below (for example,
<b>compat42</b> means that 4.2 and 42 are valid values). The
current version is also a valid value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>BASH_ENV</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If this parameter is set when
<b>bash</b> is executing a shell script, its value is
interpreted as a filename containing commands to initialize
the shell, as in <i>~/.bashrc</i>. The value of
<b><small>BASH_ENV</small></b> is subjected to parameter
expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion
before being interpreted as a filename.
<b><small>PATH</small></b> is not used to search for the
resultant filename.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>BASH_XTRACEFD</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If set to an integer
corresponding to a valid file descriptor, <b>bash</b> will
write the trace output generated when <i>set -x</i> is
enabled to that file descriptor. The file descriptor is
closed when <b><small>BASH_XTRACEFD</small></b> is unset or
assigned a new value. Unsetting
<b><small>BASH_XTRACEFD</small></b> or assigning it the
empty string causes the trace output to be sent to the
standard error. Note that setting
<b><small>BASH_XTRACEFD</small></b> to 2 (the standard error
file descriptor) and then unsetting it will result in the
standard error being closed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>CHILD_MAX</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the number of exited child

this value to be decreased below a POSIX-mandated minimum,
and there is a maximum value (currently 8192) that this may
not exceed. The minimum value is system-dependent.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>COLUMNS</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Used by the <b>select</b>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">A colon-separated list of shell
patterns (see <b>Pattern Matching</b>) defining the list of
filenames to be ignored by command search using <b>PATH</b>.
Files whose full pathnames match one of these patterns are
not considered executable files for the purposes of
completion and command execution via <b>PATH</b> lookup.
This does not affect the behavior of the <b>[</b>,
<b>test</b>, and <b>[[</b> commands. Full pathnames in the
command hash table are not subject to <b>EXECIGNORE</b>. Use
this variable to ignore shared library files that have the
executable bit set, but are not executable files. The
pattern matching honors the setting of the <b>extglob</b>
shell option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>FIGNORE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">A colon-separated list of
suffixes to ignore when performing filename completion (see
<b><small>READLINE</small></b> below). A filename whose
suffix matches one of the entries in
<b><small>FIGNORE</small></b> is excluded from the list of
matched filenames. A sample value is ".o:~"
(Quoting is needed when assigning a value to this variable,
which contains tildes).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>FUNCNEST</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If set to a numeric value
greater than 0, defines a maximum function nesting level.
Function invocations that exceed this nesting level will
cause the current command to abort.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>GLOBIGNORE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">A colon-separated list of
patterns defining the set of file names to be ignored by
pathname expansion. If a file name matched by a pathname
expansion pattern also matches one of the patterns in
<b><small>GLOBIGNORE</small></b><small>,</small> it is
removed from the list of matches.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>HISTCONTROL</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">A colon-separated list of
values controlling how commands are saved on the history
list. If the list of values includes <i>ignorespace</i>,
lines which begin with a <b>space</b> character are not
saved in the history list. A value of <i>ignoredups</i>
causes lines matching the previous history entry to not be
saved. A value of <i>ignoreboth</i> is shorthand for
<i>ignorespace</i> and <i>ignoredups</i>. A value of
<i>erasedups</i> causes all previous lines matching the
current line to be removed from the history list before that
line is saved. Any value not in the above list is ignored.
If <b><small>HISTCONTROL</small></b> is unset, or does not
include a valid value, all lines read by the shell parser
are saved on the history list, subject to the value of
<b><small>HISTIGNORE</small></b><small>.</small> The second
and subsequent lines of a multi-line compound command are
not tested, and are added to the history regardless of the
value of
<b><small>HISTCONTROL</small></b><small>.</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>HISTFILE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The name of the file in which
command history is saved (see <b><small>HISTORY</small></b>
below). The default value is <i>~/.bash_history</i>. If
unset, the command history is not saved when a shell
exits.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>HISTFILESIZE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The maximum number of lines
contained in the history file. When this variable is
assigned a value, the history file is truncated, if
necessary, to contain no more than that number of lines by
removing the oldest entries. The history file is also
truncated to this size after writing it when a shell exits.
If the value is 0, the history file is truncated to zero
size. Non-numeric values and numeric values less than zero
inhibit truncation. The shell sets the default value to the
value of <b>HISTSIZE</b> after reading any startup
files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>HISTIGNORE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">A colon-separated list of
patterns used to decide which command lines should be saved
on the history list. Each pattern is anchored at the
beginning of the line and must match the complete line (no
implicit ’<b>*</b>’ is appended). Each pattern
is tested against the line after the checks specified by
<b><small>HISTCONTROL</small></b> are applied. In addition
to the normal shell pattern matching characters,
’<b>&amp;</b>’ matches the previous history
line. ’<b>&amp;</b>’ may be escaped using a
backslash; the backslash is removed before attempting a
match. The second and subsequent lines of a multi-line
compound command are not tested, and are added to the
history regardless of the value of
<b><small>HISTIGNORE</small></b><small>.</small> The pattern
matching honors the setting of the <b>extglob</b> shell
option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>HISTSIZE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The number of commands to
remember in the command history (see
<b><small>HISTORY</small></b> below). If the value is 0,
commands are not saved in the history list. Numeric values
less than zero result in every command being saved on the
history list (there is no limit). The shell sets the default
value to 500 after reading any startup files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>HISTTIMEFORMAT</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If this variable is set and not
null, its value is used as a format string for
<a href="https://man.cx/strftime(3)">strftime(3)</a> to print the time stamp associated with
each history entry displayed by the <b>history</b> builtin.
If this variable is set, time stamps are written to the
history file so they may be preserved across shell sessions.
This uses the history comment character to distinguish
timestamps from other history lines.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Contains the name of a file in
the same format as <i>/etc/hosts</i> that should be read
when the shell needs to complete a hostname. The list of
possible hostname completions may be changed while the shell
is running; the next time hostname completion is attempted
after the value is changed, <b>bash</b> adds the contents of
the new file to the existing list. If
<b><small>HOSTFILE</small></b> is set, but has no value, or
does not name a readable file, <b>bash</b> attempts to read
<i>/etc/hosts</i> to obtain the list of possible hostname
completions. When <b><small>HOSTFILE</small></b> is unset,

character as the sole input. If set, the value is the number
of consecutive <b><small>EOF</small></b> characters which
must be typed as the first characters on an input line
before <b>bash</b> exits. If the variable exists but does
not have a numeric value, or has no value, the default value
is 10. If it does not exist, <b><small>EOF</small></b>
signifies the end of input to the shell.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>INPUTRC</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This variable controls how the
shell interacts with the user and job control. If this
variable is set, single word simple commands without
redirections are treated as candidates for resumption of an
existing stopped job. There is no ambiguity allowed; if
there is more than one job beginning with the string typed,
the job most recently accessed is selected. The <i>name</i>
of a stopped job, in this context, is the command line used
to start it. If set to the value <i>exact</i>, the string
supplied must match the name of a stopped job exactly; if
set to <i>substring</i>, the string supplied needs to match
a substring of the name of a stopped job. The
<i>substring</i> value provides functionality analogous to
the <b>%?</b> job identifier (see <b><small>JOB
CONTROL</small></b> below). If set to any other value, the
supplied string must be a prefix of a stopped job’s
name; this provides functionality analogous to the
<b>%</b><i>string</i> job identifier.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>histchars</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The two or three characters
which control history expansion and tokenization (see
<b><small>HISTORY EXPANSION</small></b> below). The first
character is the <i>history expansion</i> character, the
character which signals the start of a history expansion,
normally ’<b>!</b>’. The second character is the
<i>quick substitution</i> character, which is used as
shorthand for re-running the previous command entered,
substituting one string for another in the command. The
default is ’<b>^</b>’. The optional third
character is the character which indicates that the
remainder of the line is a comment when found as the first
character of a word, normally ’<b>#</b>’. The
history comment character causes history substitution to be
skipped for the remaining words on the line. It does not
necessarily cause the shell parser to treat the rest of the
line as a comment.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Arrays <br>
Bash</b> provides one-dimensional indexed and associative
array variables. Any variable may be used as an indexed
array; the <b>declare</b> builtin will explicitly declare an
array. There is no maximum limit on the size of an array,
nor any requirement that members be indexed or assigned
contiguously. Indexed arrays are referenced using integers
(including arithmetic expressions) and are zero-based;
associative arrays are referenced using arbitrary strings.
Unless otherwise noted, indexed array indices must be
non-negative integers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An indexed
array is created automatically if any variable is assigned
to using the syntax
<i>name</i>[<i>subscript</i>]=<i>value</i>. The
<i>subscript</i> is treated as an arithmetic expression that
must evaluate to a number. To explicitly declare an indexed
array, use <b>declare −a</b> <i>name</i> (see
<b><small>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</small></b> below).
<b>declare −a</b>
<i>name</i><b>[</b><i>subscript</i><b>]</b> is also
accepted; the <i>subscript</i> is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Associative
arrays are created using <b>declare −A</b>
<i>name</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Attributes may
be specified for an array variable using the <b>declare</b>
and <b>readonly</b> builtins. Each attribute applies to all
members of an array.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Arrays are
assigned to using compound assignments of the form
<i>name</i>=<b>(</b>value<i>1</i> ... value<i>n</i><b>)</b>,
where each <i>value</i> is of the form
[<i>subscript</i>]=<i>string</i>. Indexed array assignments
do not require anything but <i>string</i>. When assigning to
indexed arrays, if the optional brackets and subscript are
supplied, that index is assigned to; otherwise the index of
the element assigned is the last index assigned to by the
statement plus one. Indexing starts at zero.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When assigning
to an associative array, the subscript is required.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This syntax is
also accepted by the <b>declare</b> builtin. Individual
array elements may be assigned to using the
<i>name</i>[<i>subscript</i>]=<i>value</i> syntax introduced
above. When assigning to an indexed array, if <i>name</i> is
subscripted by a negative number, that number is interpreted
as relative to one greater than the maximum index of
<i>name</i>, so negative indices count back from the end of
the array, and an index of −1 references the last
element.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Any element of
an array may be referenced using
${<i>name</i>[<i>subscript</i>]}. The braces are required to
avoid conflicts with pathname expansion. If <i>subscript</i>
is <b>@</b> or <b>*</b>, the word expands to all members of
<i>name</i>. These subscripts differ only when the word
appears within double quotes. If the word is double-quoted,
${<i>name</i>[*]} expands to a single word with the value of
each array member separated by the first character of the
<b><small>IFS</small></b> special variable, and
${<i>name</i>[@]} expands each element of <i>name</i> to a
separate word. When there are no array members,
${<i>name</i>[@]} expands to nothing. If the double-quoted
expansion occurs within a word, the expansion of the first
parameter is joined with the beginning part of the original
word, and the expansion of the last parameter is joined with
the last part of the original word. This is analogous to the
expansion of the special parameters <b>*</b> and <b>@</b>
(see <b>Special Parameters</b> above).
${#<i>name</i>[<i>subscript</i>]} expands to the length of
${<i>name</i>[<i>subscript</i>]}. If <i>subscript</i> is
<b>*</b> or <b>@</b>, the expansion is the number of
elements in the array. If the <i>subscript</i> used to
reference an element of an indexed array evaluates to a
number less than zero, it is interpreted as relative to one
greater than the maximum index of the array, so negative
indices count back from the end of the array, and an index
of −1 references the last element.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Referencing an
array variable without a subscript is equivalent to
referencing the array with a subscript of 0. Any reference
to a variable using a valid subscript is legal, and
<b>bash</b> will create an array if necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An array
variable is considered set if a subscript has been assigned
a value. The null string is a valid value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is possible
to obtain the keys (indices) of an array as well as the
values. ${<b>!</b><i>name</i>[<i>@</i>]} and
${<b>!</b><i>name</i>[<i>*</i>]} expand to the indices
assigned in array variable <i>name</i>. The treatment when
in double quotes is similar to the expansion of the special
parameters <i>@</i> and <i>*</i> within double quotes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>unset</b> builtin is used to destroy arrays. <b>unset</b>
<i>name</i>[<i>subscript</i>] destroys the array element at
index <i>subscript</i>, for both indexed and associative
arrays. Negative subscripts to indexed arrays are
interpreted as described above. Unsetting the last element
of an array variable does not unset the variable.
<b>unset</b> <i>name</i>, where <i>name</i> is an array, or
<b>unset</b> <i>name</i>[<i>subscript</i>], where
<i>subscript</i> is <b>*</b> or <b>@</b>, removes the entire
array.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When using a
variable name with a subscript as an argument to a command,
such as with <b>unset</b>, without using the word expansion
syntax described above, the argument is subject to pathname
expansion. If pathname expansion is not desired, the
argument should be quoted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>declare</b>, <b>local</b>, and <b>readonly</b> builtins
each accept a <b>−a</b> option to specify an indexed
array and a <b>−A</b> option to specify an associative
array. If both options are supplied, <b>−A</b> takes
precedence. The <b>read</b> builtin accepts a
<b>−a</b> option to assign a list of words read from
the standard input to an array. The <b>set</b> and
<b>declare</b> builtins display array values in a way that
allows them to be reused as assignments.</p>

<h2><a href="https://man.cx/bash#heading14" name="heading14">EXPANSION
</a></h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Expansion is
performed on the command line after it has been split into
words. There are seven kinds of expansion performed:
<i>brace expansion</i>, <i>tilde expansion</i>, <i>parameter
and variable expansion</i>, <i>command substitution</i>,
<i>arithmetic expansion</i>, <i>word splitting</i>, and
<i>pathname expansion</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The order of
expansions is: brace expansion; tilde expansion, parameter
and variable expansion, arithmetic expansion, and command
substitution (done in a left-to-right fashion); word
splitting; and pathname expansion.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On systems that
can support it, there is an additional expansion available:
<i>process substitution</i>. This is performed at the same
time as tilde, parameter, variable, and arithmetic expansion
and command substitution.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">After these
expansions are performed, quote characters present in the
original word are removed unless they have been quoted
themselves (<i>quote removal</i>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Only brace
expansion, word splitting, and pathname expansion can
increase the number of words of the expansion; other
expansions expand a single word to a single word. The only
exceptions to this are the expansions of
"<b>$@</b>" and
"<b>${</b><i>name</i><b>[@]}</b>", and, in most
cases, <b>$*</b> and <b>${</b><i>name</i><b>[*]}</b> as
explained above (see
<b><small>PARAMETERS</small></b><small>).</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Brace
Expansion</b> <i><br>
Brace expansion</i> is a mechanism by which arbitrary
strings may be generated. This mechanism is similar to
<i>pathname expansion</i>, but the filenames generated need
not exist. Patterns to be brace expanded take the form of an
optional <i>preamble</i>, followed by either a series of
comma-separated strings or a sequence expression between a
pair of braces, followed by an optional <i>postscript</i>.
The preamble is prefixed to each string contained within the
braces, and the postscript is then appended to each
resulting string, expanding left to right.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Brace
expansions may be nested. The results of each expanded
string are not sorted; left to right order is preserved. For
example, a<b>{</b>d,c,b<b>}</b>e expands into ’ade ace
abe’.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A sequence
expression takes the form
<b>{</b><i>x</i><b>..</b><i>y</i><b>[..</b><i>incr</i><b>]}</b>,
where <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> are either integers or single
characters, and <i>incr</i>, an optional increment, is an
integer. When integers are supplied, the expression expands
to each number between <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>, inclusive.
Supplied integers may be prefixed with <i>0</i> to force
each term to have the same width. When either <i>x</i> or
<i>y</i> begins with a zero, the shell attempts to force all
generated terms to contain the same number of digits,
zero-padding where necessary. When characters are supplied,
the expression expands to each character lexicographically
between <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>, inclusive, using the default
C locale. Note that both <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> must be of
the same type. When the increment is supplied, it is used as
the difference between each term. The default increment is 1
or −1 as appropriate.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Brace expansion
is performed before any other expansions, and any characters
special to other expansions are preserved in the result. It
is strictly textual. <b>Bash</b> does not apply any
syntactic interpretation to the context of the expansion or
the text between the braces.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A
correctly-formed brace expansion must contain unquoted
opening and closing braces, and at least one unquoted comma
or a valid sequence expression. Any incorrectly formed brace
expansion is left unchanged. A <b>{</b> or <b>,</b> may be
quoted with a backslash to prevent its being considered part
of a brace expression. To avoid conflicts with parameter
expansion, the string <b>${</b> is not considered eligible
for brace expansion, and inhibits brace expansion until the
closing <b>}</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This construct
is typically used as shorthand when the common prefix of the
strings to be generated is longer than in the above
example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">mkdir
/usr/local/src/bash/{old,new,dist,bugs}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">or</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">chown root
/usr/{ucb/{ex,edit},lib/{ex?.?*,how_ex}}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Brace expansion
introduces a slight incompatibility with historical versions
of <b>sh</b>. <b>sh</b> does not treat opening or closing
braces specially when they appear as part of a word, and
preserves them in the output. <b>Bash</b> removes braces
from words as a consequence of brace expansion. For example,
a word entered to <b>sh</b> as <i>file{1,2}</i> appears
identically in the output. The same word is output as
<i>file1 file2</i> after expansion by <b>bash</b>. If strict
compatibility with <b>sh</b> is desired, start <b>bash</b>
with the <b>+B</b> option or disable brace expansion with
the <b>+B</b> option to the <b>set</b> command (see
<b><small>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</small></b> below).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Tilde
Expansion</b> <br>
If a word begins with an unquoted tilde character
(’<b>~</b>’), all of the characters preceding
the first unquoted slash (or all characters, if there is no
unquoted slash) are considered a <i>tilde-prefix</i>. If
none of the characters in the tilde-prefix are quoted, the
characters in the tilde-prefix following the tilde are
treated as a possible <i>login name</i>. If this login name
is the null string, the tilde is replaced with the value of
the shell parameter
<b><small>HOME</small></b><small>.</small> If
<b><small>HOME</small></b> is unset, the home directory of
the user executing the shell is substituted instead.
Otherwise, the tilde-prefix is replaced with the home
directory associated with the specified login name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
tilde-prefix is a ’~+’, the value of the shell
variable <b><small>PWD</small></b> replaces the
tilde-prefix. If the tilde-prefix is a
’~−’, the value of the shell variable
<b><small>OLDPWD</small></b><small>,</small> if it is set,
is substituted. If the characters following the tilde in the
tilde-prefix consist of a number <i>N</i>, optionally
prefixed by a ’+’ or a ’−’,
the tilde-prefix is replaced with the corresponding element
from the directory stack, as it would be displayed by the
<b>dirs</b> builtin invoked with the tilde-prefix as an
argument. If the characters following the tilde in the
tilde-prefix consist of a number without a leading
’+’ or ’−’, ’+’ is
assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the login
name is invalid, or the tilde expansion fails, the word is
unchanged.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each variable
assignment is checked for unquoted tilde-prefixes
immediately following a <b>:</b> or the first <b>=</b>. In
these cases, tilde expansion is also performed.
Consequently, one may use filenames with tildes in
assignments to <b><small>PATH</small></b><small>,
<b>MAILPATH</b>,</small> and
<b><small>CDPATH</small></b><small>,</small> and the shell
assigns the expanded value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Bash also
performs tilde expansion on words satisfying the conditions
of variable assignments (as described above under
<b><small>PARAMETERS</small></b><small>)</small> when they
appear as arguments to simple commands. Bash does not do
this, except for the <i>declaration</i> commands listed
above, when in <i>posix mode</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Parameter
Expansion</b> <br>
The ’<b>$</b>’ character introduces parameter
expansion, command substitution, or arithmetic expansion.
The parameter name or symbol to be expanded may be enclosed
in braces, which are optional but serve to protect the
variable to be expanded from characters immediately
following it which could be interpreted as part of the
name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When braces are
used, the matching ending brace is the first
’<b>}</b>’ not escaped by a backslash or within
a quoted string, and not within an embedded arithmetic
expansion, command substitution, or parameter expansion.
<br>
${<i>parameter</i>}</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The value of <i>parameter</i>
is substituted. The braces are required when
<i>parameter</i> is a positional parameter with more than
one digit, or when <i>parameter</i> is followed by a
character which is not to be interpreted as part of its
name. The <i>parameter</i> is a shell parameter as described
above <b>PARAMETERS</b>) or an array reference
(<b>Arrays</b>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the first
character of <i>parameter</i> is an exclamation point
(<b>!</b>), and <i>parameter</i> is not a <i>nameref</i>, it
introduces a level of indirection. <b>Bash</b> uses the
value formed by expanding the rest of <i>parameter</i> as
the new <i>parameter</i>; this is then expanded and that
value is used in the rest of the expansion, rather than the
expansion of the original <i>parameter</i>. This is known as
<i>indirect expansion</i>. The value is subject to tilde
expansion, parameter expansion, command substitution, and
arithmetic expansion. If <i>parameter</i> is a nameref, this
expands to the name of the parameter referenced by
<i>parameter</i> instead of performing the complete indirect
expansion. The exceptions to this are the expansions of
${<b>!</b><i>prefix</i><b>*</b>} and
${<b>!</b><i>name</i>[<i>@</i>]} described below. The
exclamation point must immediately follow the left brace in
order to introduce indirection.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In each of the
cases below, <i>word</i> is subject to tilde expansion,
parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic
expansion.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When not
performing substring expansion, using the forms documented
below (e.g., <b>:-</b>), <b>bash</b> tests for a parameter

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>Use Default Values</b>. If

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>Assign Default Values</b>.
If <i>parameter</i> is unset or null, the expansion of

way.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">${<i>parameter</i><b>:?</b><i>word</i>}</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>Display Error if Null or
Unset</b>. If <i>parameter</i> is null or unset, the
expansion of <i>word</i> (or a message to that effect if
<i>word</i> is not present) is written to the standard error
and the shell, if it is not interactive, exits. Otherwise,
the value of <i>parameter</i> is substituted.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">${<i>parameter</i><b>:+</b><i>word</i>}</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>Use Alternate Value</b>. If
<i>parameter</i> is null or unset, nothing is substituted,

<br>

${<i>parameter</i><b>:</b><i>offset</i><b>:</b><i>length</i>}</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>Substring Expansion</b>.
Expands to up to <i>length</i> characters of the value of
<i>parameter</i> starting at the character specified by
<i>offset</i>. If <i>parameter</i> is <b>@</b>, an indexed
array subscripted by <b>@</b> or <b>*</b>, or an associative
array name, the results differ as described below. If
<i>length</i> is omitted, expands to the substring of the
value of <i>parameter</i> starting at the character
specified by <i>offset</i> and extending to the end of the
value. <i>length</i> and <i>offset</i> are arithmetic
expressions (see <b><small>ARITHMETIC EVALUATION</small></b>
below).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If
<i>offset</i> evaluates to a number less than zero, the
value is used as an offset in characters from the end of the
value of <i>parameter</i>. If <i>length</i> evaluates to a
number less than zero, it is interpreted as an offset in
characters from the end of the value of <i>parameter</i>
rather than a number of characters, and the expansion is the
characters between <i>offset</i> and that result. Note that
a negative offset must be separated from the colon by at
least one space to avoid being confused with the <b>:-</b>
expansion.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If
<i>parameter</i> is <b>@</b>, the result is <i>length</i>
positional parameters beginning at <i>offset</i>. A negative
<i>offset</i> is taken relative to one greater than the
greatest positional parameter, so an offset of −1
evaluates to the last positional parameter. It is an
expansion error if <i>length</i> evaluates to a number less
than zero.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If
<i>parameter</i> is an indexed array name subscripted by @
or *, the result is the <i>length</i> members of the array
beginning with ${<i>parameter</i>[<i>offset</i>]}. A
negative <i>offset</i> is taken relative to one greater than
the maximum index of the specified array. It is an expansion
error if <i>length</i> evaluates to a number less than
zero.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Substring
expansion applied to an associative array produces undefined
results.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Substring
indexing is zero-based unless the positional parameters are

variable name expands to a separate word.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">${<b>!</b><i>name</i>[<i>@</i>]}
<br>
${<b>!</b><i>name</i>[<i>*</i>]}</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>List of array keys</b>. If
<i>name</i> is an array variable, expands to the list of
array indices (keys) assigned in <i>name</i>. If <i>name</i>
is not an array, expands to 0 if <i>name</i> is set and null
otherwise. When <i>@</i> is used and the expansion appears
within double quotes, each key expands to a separate
word.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">${<b>#</b><i>parameter</i>}</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>Parameter length</b>. The
length in characters of the value of <i>parameter</i> is
substituted. If <i>parameter</i> is <b>*</b> or <b>@</b>,
the value substituted is the number of positional
parameters. If <i>parameter</i> is an array name subscripted
by <b>*</b> or <b>@</b>, the value substituted is the number
of elements in the array. If <i>parameter</i> is an indexed
array name subscripted by a negative number, that number is
interpreted as relative to one greater than the maximum

from the end of the array, and an index of −1
references the last element.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>Remove matching prefix

the expanded value of <i>parameter</i> using the rules
described under <b>Pattern Matching</b> below. If the

<i>parameter</i>, then the result of the expansion is the
expanded value of <i>parameter</i> with the shortest
matching pattern (the ’’<b>#</b>’’
case) or the longest matching pattern (the
’’<b>##</b>’’ case) deleted. If

’’<b>%%</b>’’ case) deleted. If
<i>parameter</i> is <b>@</b> or <b>*</b>, the pattern
removal operation is applied to each positional parameter in
turn, and the expansion is the resultant list. If
<i>parameter</i> is an array variable subscripted with
<b>@</b> or <b>*</b>, the pattern removal operation is
applied to each member of the array in turn, and the
expansion is the resultant list.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>Pattern substitution</b>.
The <i>pattern</i> is expanded to produce a pattern just as
in pathname expansion, <i>Parameter</i> is expanded and the
longest match of <i>pattern</i> against its value is
replaced with <i>string</i>. The match is performed using
the rules described under <b>Pattern Matching</b> below. If
<i>pattern</i> begins with <b>/</b>, all matches of
<i>pattern</i> are replaced with <i>string</i>. Normally
only the first match is replaced. If <i>pattern</i> begins
with <b>#</b>, it must match at the beginning of the
expanded value of <i>parameter</i>. If <i>pattern</i> begins
with <b>%</b>, it must match at the end of the expanded
value of <i>parameter</i>. If <i>string</i> is null, matches
of <i>pattern</i> are deleted and the <b>/</b> following
<i>pattern</i> may be omitted. If the <b>nocasematch</b>
shell option is enabled, the match is performed without
regard to the case of alphabetic characters. If
<i>parameter</i> is <b>@</b> or <b>*</b>, the substitution
operation is applied to each positional parameter in turn,
and the expansion is the resultant list. If <i>parameter</i>
is an array variable subscripted with <b>@</b> or <b>*</b>,
the substitution operation is applied to each member of the
array in turn, and the expansion is the resultant list.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">${<i>parameter</i><b>^</b><i>pattern</i>}

${<i>parameter</i><b>^^</b><i>pattern</i>} <br>
${<i>parameter</i><b>,</b><i>pattern</i>} <br>
${<i>parameter</i><b>,,</b><i>pattern</i>}</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>Case modification</b>. This
expansion modifies the case of alphabetic characters in
<i>parameter</i>. The <i>pattern</i> is expanded to produce
a pattern just as in pathname expansion. Each character in
the expanded value of <i>parameter</i> is tested against
<i>pattern</i>, and, if it matches the pattern, its case is
converted. The pattern should not attempt to match more than
one character. The <b>^</b> operator converts lowercase
letters matching <i>pattern</i> to uppercase; the <b>,</b>
operator converts matching uppercase letters to lowercase.
The <b>^^</b> and <b>,,</b> expansions convert each matched
character in the expanded value; the <b>^</b> and <b>,</b>
expansions match and convert only the first character in the
expanded value. If <i>pattern</i> is omitted, it is treated
like a <b>?</b>, which matches every character. If
<i>parameter</i> is <b>@</b> or <b>*</b>, the case
modification operation is applied to each positional
parameter in turn, and the expansion is the resultant list.
If <i>parameter</i> is an array variable subscripted with
<b>@</b> or <b>*</b>, the case modification operation is
applied to each member of the array in turn, and the
expansion is the resultant list.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">${<i>parameter</i><b>@</b><i>operator</i>}</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>Parameter
transformation</b>. The expansion is either a transformation
of the value of <i>parameter</i> or information about
<i>parameter</i> itself, depending on the value of
<i>operator</i>. Each <i>operator</i> is a single
letter:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If
<i>parameter</i> is <b>@</b> or <b>*</b>, the operation is
applied to each positional parameter in turn, and the

array variable subscripted with <b>@</b> or <b>*</b>, the
operation is applied to each member of the array in turn,

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The result of
the expansion is subject to word splitting and pathname
expansion as described below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Command
Substitution</b> <i><br>
Command substitution</i> allows the output of a command to
replace the command name. There are two forms:</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>$(</b><i>command</i><b>)</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">or</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>`</b><i>command</i><b>`</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Bash</b>
performs the expansion by executing <i>command</i> in a
subshell environment and replacing the command substitution
with the standard output of the command, with any trailing
newlines deleted. Embedded newlines are not deleted, but
they may be removed during word splitting. The command
substitution <b>$(cat</b> <i>file</i><b>)</b> can be
replaced by the equivalent but faster <b>$(&lt;</b>
<i>file</i><b>)</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When the
old-style backquote form of substitution is used, backslash
retains its literal meaning except when followed by
<b>$</b>, <b>`</b>, or <b>\</b>. The first backquote not
preceded by a backslash terminates the command substitution.
When using the $(<i>command</i>) form, all characters
between the parentheses make up the command; none are
treated specially.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Command
substitutions may be nested. To nest when using the
backquoted form, escape the inner backquotes with
backslashes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
substitution appears within double quotes, word splitting
and pathname expansion are not performed on the results.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Arithmetic
Expansion</b> <br>
Arithmetic expansion allows the evaluation of an arithmetic
expression and the substitution of the result. The format
for arithmetic expansion is:</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>$((</b><i>expression</i><b>))</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The old format
<b>$[</b><i>expression</i><b>]</b> is deprecated and will be
removed in upcoming versions of bash.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>expression</i> is treated as if it were within double
quotes, but a double quote inside the parentheses is not
treated specially. All tokens in the expression undergo
parameter and variable expansion, command substitution, and
quote removal. The result is treated as the arithmetic
expression to be evaluated. Arithmetic expansions may be
nested.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The evaluation
is performed according to the rules listed below under
<b><small>ARITHMETIC EVALUATION</small></b><small>.</small>
If <i>expression</i> is invalid, <b>bash</b> prints a
message indicating failure and no substitution occurs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Process
Substitution</b> <i><br>
Process substitution</i> allows a process’s input or
output to be referred to using a filename. It takes the form
of <b>&lt;(</b><i>list</i><b>)</b> or
